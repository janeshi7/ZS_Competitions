**1. Kaggle: Allstate Event Prediction Competition**     \
**Problem:** Given the prior events of a customer through his/her lifetime (client_id, timestamp and event_code), predict the next event (event_code) that will happen in his/her life. \
**Solution:** feature engineering and gradient boosting. \
**Outcome:** LL = 0.38, ranked 2nd place in UChicago.    \

**2. Kaggle: Otto classification competition**           \
**Problem:** For this competition, we have provided a dataset with 93 features for more than 200,000 products. The objective is to build a predictive model which is able to distinguish between our main product categories. \
**Solution:** stacking model in the use of 8 generated features, random forest, KNN, neural network, gradient boosting, etc.\
**Outcome:** LL = 0.46, beated the baseline (LL = 0.48) and ranked top 25%. \
